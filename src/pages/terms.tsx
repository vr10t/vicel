                  The intellectual property in the materials contained in this
                  website are owned by or licensed to Vicel Ltd and are
                  protected by applicable copyright and trademark law. We grant

                <p>
                  This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of
                  title. This license shall automatically terminate if you
                  violate any of these restrictions or the Terms of Service, and
                  may be terminated by Vicel Ltd at any time.

                <p>
                  You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over
                  content you submit to us for publication on our website. We
                  will never claim ownership of your content, but we do require
                  a license from you in order to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you use our website or its associated services to post,
                  upload, share, or otherwise transmit content covered by
                  intellectual property rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive,
                  royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license
                  to use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly display,
                  translate, or otherwise create derivative works of your
                  content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy
                  preferences and our Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by
                  deleting your content. However, to the extent that we (or our
                  partners) have used your content in connection with commercial
                  or sponsored content, the license will continue until the
                  relevant commercial or post has been discontinued by us.

                <p>
                  Our website and the materials on our website are provided on
                  an ‘as is’ basis. To the extent permitted by law, Vicel Ltd
                  makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby
                  disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
                  limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
                  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                  non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation
                  of rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In no event shall Vicel Ltd or its suppliers be liable for any
                  consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third
                  party arising from the use or inability to use this website or
                  the materials on this website, even if Vicel Ltd or an
                  authorized representative has been notified, orally or in
                  writing, of the possibility of such damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss”
                  includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or
                  anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue,
                  loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss
                  of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or
                  corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity,
                  tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                  warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
                  incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
